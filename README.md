# Weather Dashboard

***

During this challenge, I was given the task to present the current and future weather conditions for the city that the user requests. The user is shown the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. Cities that they previously searched for are saved in the search history and can be clicked on to be seen again.

## Work Completed

***

* Used bootstrap to design the entire page
* Used the OpenWeather API to prompt the user with current and upcoming weather
